Chalmers Chance - The classic Risk game, but on Chalmers campus.
Brought to you by Spelkväll?

The main objective of the game is to conquer Chalmers campus (in a friendly manner of course), by deploying, attacking
and moving units.

If you want to beat your friends (or enemies) here are some useful information:

When in-game, you can use the escape-key to pause the game.

You get extra units to deploy in the deploy-phase depending on the amount of spaces you hold according to the following
formula:

+ ( 1 + ( Spaces / 2 ) ) units

You can get extra units by holding entire areas as well:

+ 7 units: Kårhuset

+ 5 units: SB, Maskinhuset, Kemigården, Vasa

+ 3 units: EDIT, Lindholmen

More information about Risk and its rules can be find online.

To start the application you need to run the javafx-plugin.

Here are some easy ways to do this (that hopefully work).

Terminal:
1. Move to the OOPP-Spelkvall folder.
2. Write "mvn javafx:run".

IntelliJ IDEA:
1.1 Go to your Maven-settings.
1.2 Go to Chans > Plugins > javafx > javafx:run and double-click

2.1 Go to "Edit Configurations..."
2.2 Add a new Maven configuration.
2.3 Write "javafx:run" in the commandline option
2.4 Press OK
2.5 Choose the new configuration and run it.

If Maven is not your friend, but you really want to play some Chalmers Chance. Try to run the main class "Chans" as you
usually do in an IDE. (You may need to fix some errors that pops up)

As of now, we do not have a server constantly running, this have the consequence that if you wish to host yourself,
you'll need to take some extra steps.

To play online, you need to update the IP-address in the code to match your computers IP-address, and make sure whoever
you are playing with does the same (change to your IP-address). You may also need to open up a port for the connection,
remember to specify what port in the code and notify the other players.

We wish you the very best in life and hope you enjoy our game :)
