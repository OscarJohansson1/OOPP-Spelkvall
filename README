2. Write "mvn javafx:run".

IntelliJ IDEA:
1.1 Go to your Maven-settings.
1.2 Go to Chans > Plugins > javafx > javafx:run and double-click

2.1 Go to "Edit Configurations..."
2.2 Add a new Maven configuration.
2.3 Write "javafx:run" in the commandline option
2.4 Press OK

If Maven is not your friend, but you really want to play some Chalmers Chance. Try to run the main class "Chans" as you
usually do in an IDE. (You may need to fix some errors that pops up)
